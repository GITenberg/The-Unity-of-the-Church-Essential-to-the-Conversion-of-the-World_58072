3</span>SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Neither pray I for these alone</i>,
<i>but for all who shall believe in me through their Word</i>:
<i>that they all may be one</i>: <i>that the World may believe
that thou hast sent me</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">John</span> xvii. 20, 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last earthly act of one we love and honour, is often
referred to with deepest interest, and revolved with the most
thoughtful attention.&nbsp; It is then that the dying Parent
delivers his solemn counsels, and unbosoms his most sacredly
cherished feelings.&nbsp; If ever the tenderest and earnest
workings of the heart are laid open, it is as the scene draws
near and yet nearer to its close.</p>
<p>And as our beloved <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
approached the termination of His earthly history, the strong
commanding feelings of his soul were displayed, and then
especially he taught his disciples what sentiments he would have
them cultivate, and what objects he would have them propose;
whilst by his example, he taught them in <i>what spirit</i>, and
by <i>what means</i> to <i>seek those</i> high and holy ends.</p>
<p>It was then, assembled with his disciples in the Garden of
Gethsemane, that He as the Great High Priest of Our Profession,
breathed forth in earnest prayer, the words before us:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The <i>last acts</i> of the
Great Mediator, were <i>acts of prayer</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> prayed! that he might impress
his people with the importance of prayer.&nbsp; He made them
<i>witnesses</i> of his prayer, that when they hereafter might
follow him their divine intercessor, <i>by faith</i>, within the
veil, they might know for what ends, and in what spirit, his
intercession is carried on.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">His last
acts</span> <i>were prayer</i>.&nbsp; It was in <i>prayer</i>
that he closed his last interview with his Apostles.&nbsp; It was
in this exercise that he passed his hour of agony in the Garden;
and when on the Cross, His dying breath was spent in repeated and
solemn application.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Oh!
beloved brethren! &rsquo;twas a solemn scene;&mdash;the adorable
Mediator with the shadows of death deepening around him, employed
in earnest addresses to his <span
class="smcap">Father</span>.&nbsp; The Garden&mdash;the Judgment
Seat&mdash;the Scourge&mdash;the Cross, were full before
him.&nbsp; On what now is His spirit bent?&nbsp; On what subjects
does he meditate?&nbsp; His prayer will tell, and tell how fully
his heart was occupied with the work of mercy&mdash;the
well-being of his church&mdash;the honour of his Father&mdash;the
salvation of the world.&nbsp; It was then he uttered the prayer
in which he sought for his people, that they all may be one, that
the world may be converted to him.&nbsp; He had <i>charged</i>
them &ldquo;to love one another.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had shown them
that they were <i>virtually</i> &ldquo;all one:&rdquo;&nbsp; By
the sacred supper, he had sought to cherish their love and union,
and now by his example he taught them to make it the burden of
their prayer.&nbsp; And even still his heart longs for
this!&nbsp; He looks down from his exalted throne, upon that
church which he so much regards, and which he &ldquo;has
purchased with his own blood;&rdquo; that church to which he has
entrusted such a high and glorious work; big with the richest
blessings for a ruined and wretched world.&nbsp; He sees that
church divided, torn, distracted, alienations and strifes
prevailing, whilst the world&rsquo;s millions are waiting,
<i>uninstructed</i>, <i>unenlightened</i>, <i>unblest</i>; and
then, having connected the conversion of the world with the unity
of the church, he again pours forth the intercession,
&ldquo;Father, may they all be one, that the world may believe
that thou hast sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the endeavour to fulfil that duty, which the Directors of
the London Missionary Society have assigned me, I feel I need
your sympathy, and your prayers.&nbsp; I stand before you
&ldquo;in weakness, and in fear, and in much
trembling.&rdquo;&nbsp; From a sense of my own insufficiency to
perform this duty aright, as well as from the conviction that I
may be standing in the room of some more qualified and acceptable
advocate of the cause, I was naturally reluctant to leave the
quietude of a country village and place myself in this public
situation: on the other hand, believing that this was a call from
<span class="smcap">God</span>, to bear my humble testimony to
His truth in this great Metropolis, and that in endeavouring to
do his will, we shall not fail of his grace; I have come beloved
brethren, and would seek to offer a few remarks upon the
interesting subject now introduced to your notice.&nbsp; The
subject I am fully aware, is now one of those to which so much
attention has been given of late years, that I cannot hope to
present it more clearly or forcibly than it has already been
placed in your view: all I can attempt is to bring these things
again to your remembrance, and again to urge them upon the
attentive consideration of the Christian Church.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>In doing
so, I propose to consider three things&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">I.&nbsp; The object, which in this Petition,
the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> seeks.</p>
<p class="gutindent">II.&nbsp; The means by which it is to be
promoted.</p>
<p class="gutindent">III.&nbsp; The reasons why it should be most
earnestly desired.</p>
<p>We must proceed to notice:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<i>The object</i>, <i>which in this petition the
Saviour seeks</i>.</p>
<p>It is the unity of all <i>believers</i> upon Earth.&nbsp; Not
indeed that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is indifferent to
the peace and love which ought to bind together <i>all
mankind</i> as one great family.&nbsp; He purposes to secure
<i>this</i>; but he seeks to bless His Church, that thro&rsquo;
it he may bless the world.&nbsp; Yes! beloved brethren,&mdash;Men
ought to &ldquo;<i>be one</i>&rdquo; in the bonds of love and
kindness.&nbsp; We are Brethren, all &ldquo;one man&rsquo;s
sons,&rdquo; and where there is a man, there is one who has a
claim upon the thoughtfulness, the care, the kindness of his
fellow man; and in order to promote the general well-being of our
species, we should be <i>as one</i>.&nbsp; To us there cry the
poor in their destitution&mdash;the ignorant in their
darkness&mdash;the oppressed in their wrongs&mdash;the victims of
war, murderous and impious war&mdash;the slaves in the chains,
which tyranny has thrown around their persons, or set on their
intellect and conscience; <i>these</i>, and sufferers in every
other form of woe, appeal to <i>man</i>, the <i>family</i>, the
<i>fraternity</i> of man, for sympathy, pity, and relief.&nbsp;
They are Men; they are Brethren; and these are outrages against
our common claims, which should rouse all that hear the cry, to
succour the suppliants.&nbsp; We have all one <span
class="smcap">Father</span>, and happy will be the time, when His
divided and distracted household, shall again &ldquo;love as
brethren;&rdquo; when the oppressor shall cease; when
&ldquo;violence shall not be heard in our borders;&rdquo; when
the clangor of war shall give place to the melting sounds and
celestial song of &ldquo;Peace on earth, and good will towards
men;&rdquo; when truth shall fill all intellects, and love reign
in every heart.&nbsp; Bright!&nbsp; Glorious Day!&mdash;And shall
this happy consummation ever bless this afflicted, burdened,
groaning world?&nbsp; It shall!&nbsp; The Gospel <i>purposes
it</i>, and to secure its accomplishment, the Gospel is daily
putting forth its heavenly energy, and ere long, earth in love
shall be the very emblem of the heaven of heavens.&nbsp; The
fierce passions of the human spirit shall be subdued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard
shall lie down with the kid&rdquo;; &ldquo;the cow and bear shall
feed&rdquo;: &ldquo;they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as the waters cover the
sea.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> xi,
6&ndash;9.</p>
<p>But another work must precede this.&nbsp; The Church must
first be <i>made one itself</i>.&nbsp; The universal harmony
predicted, and eventually to be realized in the world, must first
pervade the elements of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
Visible Church, and therefore as a means to that great end, even
that <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the
world may believe in, fully recognize, and submit to the
authority of Him, whom <span class="smcap">God</span> has sent,
the Redeemer here prays, that His disciples may &ldquo;be
one;&rdquo; implying thereby that the unity of the Church, is the
great pre-requisite for the conversion of the world.</p>
<p>1.&mdash;<i>And who are His Church</i>, <i>His People</i>,
<i>the subjects of this prayer</i>?</p>
<p>None but those who rest upon His atonement, and rely upon His
grace, as the one foundation of their hope for eternity.&nbsp; It
is not the bearing of a Christian name; it is not an enrolment in
any society, however scriptural in doctrine and apostolic in
discipline that constitutes men Christians.&nbsp; There may be
loud profession&mdash;an orthodox creed&mdash;ceaseless
activity&mdash;large sacrifices, without <i>faith</i> in <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> or <i>love</i> to his name.&nbsp; But
<i>these</i> are indispensible; without <i>them</i> there is no
interest or fellowship with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
and no part, or lot in His Church.&nbsp; Without <i>faith</i>,
there is no salvation; and &ldquo;if any man love not our <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span> he must be
accursed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The possessors of these alone, are the
true &ldquo;living stones built up a spiritual house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Church includes <i>all who believe on the Son of
God</i>, among whatever community they may be found.&nbsp; Each
christian may <i>have</i>, and ought to hold <i>dear</i>, his
convictions, as to the truths the bible teaches, and the church
principles which are there developed.</p>
<p>The Bible is ever to be his standard, and his conscience binds
him to receive <i>all</i> that it teaches.&nbsp; We plead for no
latitudinarian indifference.&nbsp; We have <i>our</i>
convictions, nor dare we yield them, unless <span
class="smcap">God</span> should, by His Spirit, afford us another
view of truth; nor will any candid christian, who differs from
us, call for such a sacrifice.&nbsp; We ask not for such
unwarranted concessions from any.&nbsp; Nor dare we judge the
<span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> servants; to their own
Master they stand or fall.&nbsp; To Him they are amenable, and it
cheers the spirit to think that our minor errors and
imperfections hinder not Him from receiving any who rest on Him
for mercy, and yield to Him their hearts.</p>
<p><i>All these are His people</i>&mdash;they are parts of His
universal Church; though severed from each other, they are one
with Him; members of His mystical body; branches in Him the
Living Vine!</p>
<p>And where shall we seek them?&nbsp; They are found adorning
fellowships of varied names, and each possessing features of
peculiar beauty, and sacred excellence.&nbsp; We dare not say
that a connexion with any system of itself can make men
Christians; nor of Episcopacy, Presbyterianism,
Congregationalism, nor Methodism, that it is exclusively <span
class="smcap">The Church of God</span>, so as to monopolize all
sacred relations and existing piety.&nbsp; But we believe that
genuine disciples of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> are to be
found amongst them all.</p>
<p>The churches which have numbered among them a Fletcher, a
Henry Martyn, a Cary, a Williams, a Wesley; will furnish their <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>portion towards
the one great assembly, &ldquo;the church of the first born
written in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The genuine disciples of the <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>, are to be found in various ranks,
and among different denominations of Christians; from these many
have been gathered already, and swell the throng around the
throne of <span class="smcap">God</span> above.&nbsp; Even now
the multitude collected from among them, is greater than any man
can number; they have lost their party badges and sectarian
titles.&nbsp; This is their only distinction, &ldquo;They have
washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
Lamb,&rdquo;&mdash;and they need no other&mdash;this is their
great <i>title</i>&mdash;this secures them a happy, blissful
place before the throne of <span class="smcap">God</span> and the
Lamb; and they desire no more.</p>
<p>And many yet are found <i>below</i>.&nbsp; True our minds are
distracted by the differing names and varied distinctions which
exist among us.&nbsp; But be of good cheer, beloved brethren,
upon a goodly company, though widely scattered, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> looks down with joy, seeing in each
of the throng, a trophy of his love; a soul saved by his
sacrifice, and transforming to his image.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> prayer
contemplated <i>all these</i>, and sought that they may <i>all be
one</i>.&nbsp; And indeed they so far are even now
<i>one</i>.</p>
<p>There is a bond which binds them to each other, which no power
can sever.&nbsp; It is that spiritual tie which unites them to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>; in Him they are all one.&nbsp;
They were <span class="smcap">one</span> in <i>ruin</i>&mdash;in
separation from <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;in captivity
to Satan&mdash;in exposure to eternal death.&nbsp; They now are
partakers in a common salvation&mdash;redeemed by the same
blood&mdash;renewed by the same Spirit&mdash;relying upon one
Saviour&mdash;Children of one Parent, they form one holy family,
and will spend an eternity together in their
&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s House.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus real, substantial,
and indissoluble is their union.&nbsp; They are one, as <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> is in the <span
class="smcap">Father</span> and the <span
class="smcap">Father</span> in Him.</p>
<p>But, alas! this ill accords with the aspect they present to
the world, and the attitude in which they stand to each other;
nor can the prayer of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> be
silent, until the <i>one-ness</i> of his people shall be
<i>felt</i>, and their union shall be manifest to all.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;Then we may further enquire&mdash;<i>Wherein must
such union consist</i>?&nbsp; It is clear, not in the adoption of
<i>one common name</i>; for such may be, and the aim be entirely
lost, and the object of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
unattained.&nbsp; Something of this kind was realized in the dark
ages.&nbsp; The Church of Rome then contained within itself well
nigh all existing nominal Christianity.&nbsp; But did this, think
you, brethren, realize the prayer of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>?&nbsp; <i>One</i> name embraced men of
every varied creed, and covered every form of abomination.&nbsp;
A one-ness, where except for the title &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo;
and for the form of godliness, no <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>religion seemed to exist; life and
soul were lost, the frame-work alone remaining.&nbsp; This
one-ness was that of the tenants of the sepulchre and the grave
yard, where the fellowship was that of an universal corruption,
and the calm was the stillness&mdash;the silence of death, only
broken by here and there a mourner, weeping that the dry bones
were so many, and that they were so very dry.</p>
<p>No, this is not the peace we long for, and for which <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> prays.&nbsp; Better, a thousand fold
better, is our present state, than such an unity as that.&nbsp;
It is at least replete with <i>life</i>, though disfigured by
diversities.&nbsp; We have spirit, and we have power; though that
spirit is too frequently expended in strife, and that power in
warfare.</p>
<p>The <i>first thing essential</i> to the attainment of
Christian Unity is, that Christians should be brought to
<i>feel</i> that real one-ness, which even now exists between
them.</p>
<p>There is a principle which is inseparable from the existence
of vital godliness, and that is faith in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Now if all who look to the
work of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> for justification, and
confide in the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> for
sanctification, are really Christians, why should they not be
felt to be such, and loved as brethren?&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> loves them,&mdash;let them love each
other.&nbsp; To all of them <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is
precious; then let our hearts embrace with ardour all &ldquo;who
love our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, in
sincerity;&rdquo; and if we can do this, there will be but little
difficulty in rendering that unity visible.&nbsp; How can it be
concealed?&nbsp; For where there is true love, there must to some
extent be friendly intercourse&mdash;sympathy will be
engendered&mdash;in spite of existing distinctions, love will
draw us together into kindly greetings, and social
fellowship.&nbsp; Nor will there be wanting opportunities of
co-operation in efforts to diffuse the Bible, extend the Gospel,
and convert immortal souls.</p>
<p>And even where this may not be, there will be witnessed a
cordial interest in each other&rsquo;s labors of love; we shall
rejoice when prosperity attends the work of others employed with
us in the same holy enterprize, and mingle our tears with those
which disappointments cause to flow from the eyes of our beloved
and devoted brethren; and only let this but be realized, and all
bitterness, and envy, and malice, will speedily disappear.&nbsp;
If Christians differ in opinion, yet they will agree in heart; if
they are constrained to exhibit their views strongly, they will
aim to do so with &ldquo;the meekness of wisdom,&rdquo; and with
the kindness of charity.</p>
<p>Oh, for this consummation!&nbsp; Believers, labour and pray
for it&mdash;sacrifice for its attainment your party
jealousies&mdash;mortify carnal prejudices, and crucify the
spirit of bigotry; and thus hasten the accomplishment of the
<span class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> prayer, when we shall
all be <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>one&mdash;<i>one</i> in love&mdash;<i>one</i> in our
great aim for reviving the church, and saving the
world&mdash;<i>one</i> in fervent prayer&mdash;and shall all
value, more than any other title, the <i>one</i> new name given
to the disciples at Antioch.</p>
<p>Having considered somewhat at length <i>the object which in
this</i> petition of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, he
more <i>especially seeks</i>; namely, the unity of his Disciples;
a one-ness in his Church; let us in the second place, advert to
<i>the means by which it is to be promoted</i>.</p>
<p>And here I need scarcely remark, that <i>coercion</i> can do
nothing: neither ecclesiastical canons, nor authoritative edicts,
can sway the conscience, or influence the affections.&nbsp; Nor
can even much reliance he placed on moral suasion, or
controversial discussion.&nbsp; We may acknowledge the importance
of the object, but be after all undecided as to the method of its
attainment, or indifferent to its ultimate success.&nbsp; The
great means are with <span class="smcap">God</span>; yet all of
us can do something towards the promotion of Christian Union, and
I would humbly suggest the following hints:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&mdash;<i>By personally cherishing</i>, <i>and prominently
keeping in view those great truths upon which the Church of
Christ has agreed</i>.</p>
<p>For after all, to use the admirable language of a Christian
author upon this subject; &ldquo;The unity which the Church of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> should maintain within, and
promote without, even in our present circumstances exists, and
that substantially, though imperfectly.&nbsp; Its existence is
proved by an identity of motives and aims; proved by that
similarity of sentiment, which makes the Christian find a new
brother in every converted man; proved by petitions and praises,
like in matter and in manner, and offered to the same throne of
grace; proved by the general correspondence of our forms of
worship.&nbsp; Were some enlightened heathen, such as Cicero, to
rise up and come among us, he would perceive little difference
among the purest Christians, unless his attention were called to
it by some formal partisan.&nbsp; The grand and glorious features
of the Christian faith, would stand out before him in bright
contrast with those of heathenism, if our paltry animosities did
not obscure them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us then set before us, and steadfastly gaze upon the great
soul-elevating, and spirit-uniting doctrines of the Gospel.&nbsp;
The atonement of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;His
perfect work&mdash;finished redemption&mdash;spotless
righteousness&mdash;all prevailing intercession, and final
conquest.&nbsp; The work of the Spirit in the regeneration,
sanctification, and perfection of believers.&nbsp; These are the
great master-truths; let them be to our souls, what they are to
the Gospel, the Alpha and Omega, the foundation of all; and much
will be done in enlarging our views, <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>refining our judgments, breaking down
prejudice within, and concentrating our affections upon points of
general agreement.&nbsp; In addition to this, let the mind of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> be ours.&nbsp; His mind was
absorbed with love to his <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and
compassion for souls.&nbsp; Cherish the same; let this
predominant passion occupy and control our spirits, and there
will then be but little space found, and less taste felt for
those trifles which distract, divide, and embitter.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;We may promote this Christian Unity further, <i>by
seeking to form</i>, <i>and convey a right impression of our own
excellence</i>, <i>in comparison with the worth of others</i>
&ldquo;<i>who follow not with us</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are too prone to dwell with much of sectarian gratulation,
upon the peculiar advantages of <i>our own</i> communion, or the
evidences of divine favour we have been blessed with; to the
disparagement of others, from whom we differ.&nbsp; That spirit,
whilst it leads us to vain boasting, as infallibly leads to a
despising of our brethren.&nbsp; Rather let as mourn over our own
imperfections and short-comings; let us recall to mind how feeble
and often futile have been our efforts; how our piety has mingled
with much <i>of earthliness</i>, our love with much <i>of
selfishness</i>, our zeal with much <i>of partiality</i>, and our
devotedness with much <i>of self exaltation</i>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let us be willing not only to allow, but
even to rejoice in the excellencies of others&mdash;to ponder
their worth and their works&mdash;to cast the sin-covering mantle
of true christian charity over the infirmities of our brethren,
and to rejoice with them in their success, weep with them in
their discouragements, and aid them in their necessity.&nbsp;
Thus we shall, as saith St. Paul, &ldquo;look not every man on
his own things, but every man also on the things of
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each preferring his brother in honour and in
love.&nbsp; The bonds of christian union will be strengthened,
and the dove-like spirit of peace condescend to dwell in the
hearts of christians, constraining even the world, as of old, to
confess&mdash;&ldquo;see how these disciples love one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&mdash;<i>Christian Unity is to be promoted by co-operation
in those wise schemes of christian effort</i>, <i>which may
consistently embrace all who love the Saviour</i>.</p>
<p>Co-operation has ever been found very powerful in producing
and sustaining unity.&nbsp; In such christian efforts, there is a
common object proposed; a measure of agreement in the means to be
employed, in order to its attainment; a participation in
responsibility; a sympathy in trials; an interest in success; all
which bind kindred hearts; unite in holy brotherhood those who
share in the same common-wealth and privilege; and allay those
feelings of envy and jealousy which have so fearfully agitated
and divided the body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Thanks
be to <span class="smcap">God</span>, we live in an age, when
such efforts are put forth, in which we may conscientiously
co-operate with our brethren, in the great and glorious designs
they contemplate.&nbsp; By so doing, we shall help much to
complete the unity of the Church.</p>
<p>Yet, beloved brethren, why enumerate more means?&nbsp; There
is one influence, which adequately employed, would secure the
whole.&nbsp; What want we, but a large and universal effusion of
the Holy Spirit?&nbsp; Oh, yes! this would do it all.</p>
<p>It would fix our gaze upon ourselves, until we sank abased in
the dust.&nbsp; It would attract us all to the cross; that whilst
drawn to one common centre, all would be drawn closer to each
other.&nbsp; Such would appear the transcendent glories of that
object, that all others would in comparison lose their power to
charm or interest us.&nbsp; The ruin, guilt, danger, wants, and
woes of a perishing world, would awaken our tenderest compassion
and ever watchful solicitude.</p>
<p>Eternity unveiled&mdash;heaven in its peerless
glories&mdash;hell in its hopeless torment, would so bring our
spirits under the &ldquo;powers of the world to come;&rdquo; that
we should be blind, and deaf to all things of inferior
moment.&nbsp; Were this gracious influence but felt and
cherished, all would indeed be one.&nbsp; Divisions would be
healed.&nbsp; Stumbling blocks be removed.&nbsp; Hearts joined to
hearts.&nbsp; Joys mingled with joys; and the blessed <span
class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> prayer, receive its full
accomplishment, and His people be one, even as He and the <span
class="smcap">Father</span> are one.</p>
<p>It remains for me in the Third place, to direct your attention
<i>to the reasons</i>, <i>why this Christian Unity should be so
earnestly desired</i>.</p>
<p>Now here we might, if it were necessary, advert to many and
weighty reasons, for seeking to promote and increase this spirit
in the church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; I shall
only however, fix upon the two more immediately connected with
the text; the one <i>implied</i>, and the other <i>expressed</i>
by it.&nbsp; The first is derived from <i>its being the great
prevailing desire of our divine Redeemer</i>.&nbsp; It rested
much upon His heart, or he would not have prayed so earnestly for
it.&nbsp; He was then going forth to gird himself for His arduous
undertaking.&nbsp; He was about to engage in fierce conflict with
the powers of darkness.&nbsp; He had before him the
accomplishment of a glorious work&mdash;the vindication of the
divine honor&mdash;the illustration of the divine
perfections!&mdash;the recovery of a ruined and apostate
race&mdash;the establishment of a kingdom, which eventually
should be co-extensive with the world.&nbsp; In doing all this,
he would have to pass through scenes of humiliation, suffering,
and death.&nbsp; He would have to assert his victory over death
and the grave, by raising himself, and &ldquo;spoiling
principalities and powers, make a shew of them openly, triumphing
over them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would finally have to ascend up on
high, &ldquo;leading captivity captive,&rdquo; to receive his <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>reward, and
claim his kingdom; to mark the success of his cause, and the
triumphs of his cross.&nbsp; But he plainly foresaw how
intimately that success, and these triumphs, were connected with
the unity of his disciples&mdash;how preeminently their one-ness
constituted their strength&mdash;of what vast importance to his
ultimate conquest of the world, was the mutual agreement and
brotherly love, which His people should evince.&nbsp; And so he
interceded, with a spirit yearning for the fulfilment, and deeply
interested in the result, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Father</span> I pray that they all may be
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if this desire be so strong on the part of the Redeemer;
if this unity be dear to him, should we not, His professing
followers, esteem it as worthy of our regard?&nbsp; Yea! as of
the first moment?&nbsp; Can we feel indifferent, when the honor
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the glory of <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> are involved?&nbsp; Can we be
<i>unconcerned</i> spectators of the present divided and
discordant spirit which prevails among us?</p>
<p>Nay, surely christians, your master longs for unity.&nbsp; Lay
aside every other consideration, and let his will be paramount,
and your desire and prayer be &ldquo;that they all may be
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other reason I would adduce for the cultivation of this
spirit, arises from the direct <i>influence such unity is to have
upon the conversion of the world</i>, (as stated in my text,)
&ldquo;I pray that they may all be one, (in order,) that (as a
means to an end,) the world may believe that thou hast sent
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusion then, at which I would desire to arrive, is,
that such unity is essential to the final triumph of the Gospel;
that if we desire the latter we must seek to promote the former;
and in fact, that unless we are willing to strive
for&mdash;sacrifice for&mdash;pray for the spirit of unity; our
efforts, zeal, and devotedness will be virtually defeated.</p>
<p>And now look, beloved brethren, what is the state of the world
in this the nineteenth century?&nbsp; Eighteen hundred years have
rolled away, since the command was given by the Great head of the
church, the risen and ascending <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>, &ldquo;go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.&rdquo;&nbsp; And still
the Prince of darkness maintains his sway among the
nations.&nbsp; Idolatry and superstition, the chief pillars of
his throne, are resting in almost every land.&nbsp; Darkness
still covers the earth, and gross darkness, the people.&nbsp; Out
of 900 millions of immortal souls, scarcely 300 millions are even
nominally Christians.&nbsp; To multitudes the name of <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> is a sound unknown; and the glad
tidings of His grace and salvation strange things.</p>
<p>My brethren, ought these things so to be?&nbsp; Or would these
things have so been, if the church of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> had risen to her duty; in a word, had
greater union prevailed among her members?&nbsp; She has <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>had strength,
resources, opportunities; she has not lacked zeal, intelligence,
nor encouragement; but she has expended her strength, in that
which profiteth nothing; her resources, in fostering intestine
warfare; and perverted her opportunities, to promote sectarian
dogmas, and anti-christian strife.&nbsp; We are called bitterly
to mourn these departures from the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; and thus with shame, to confess that
we are verily guilty concerning our heathen brethren.&nbsp; Upon
the christian church, has been laid the obligation to preach to
them the Gospel; but alas! we have fearfully neglected our duty,
or at least very inadequately performed it.</p>
<p>But see, my beloved brethren, what influence this christian
unity would exert, and what consequences would follow from it in
the conversion of the world.&nbsp; <i>For the church would then
be a witness for the truths and excellence of the glorious
gospel</i>&mdash;and how important is that!&nbsp; It is in <i>the
church</i> that the men of the world study the gospel.&nbsp; They
care not to investigate its real nature, as revealed in the
bible&mdash;they care not to study its features, in the character
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;they care not to
attend to its delineation in the ordinance of preaching.&nbsp;
But they <i>can</i> see it in professors&mdash;and they will
scrutinize their character, and keen sighted and vigilant are
they in detecting evil, and discerning imperfections.&nbsp; And
how invariably have the division, discord, and strifes of the
church, laid a stumbling block in the way of the
enquirer&mdash;strengthened the worldly in their prejudices
against the truth, and confirmed the unbeliever in his
incredulity and contempt.</p>
<p>But on the other hand; a church, <i>spiritual</i>,
<i>zealous</i>, <i>devoted</i>, <i>one in love to each other</i>,
in love to <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and love to souls,
would bear upon itself its own credentials.&nbsp; The world
convinced by such evidence, and impressed by such scenes, would
acknowledge &ldquo;that <span class="smcap">God</span> was with
us of a truth,&rdquo; our religion would be honoured, and
&ldquo;the name of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus
Christ</span> glorified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again&mdash;<i>if such unity existed and prevailed</i>,
<i>the whole undivided energies and resources of the church</i>,
<i>would be at liberty</i>, <i>and ready to be devoted to the
extension of the gospel</i>, <i>and the salvation of the
world</i>.</p>
<p>Much strength is now lost in our conflicts with each
other&mdash;much squandered upon vain and profitless
discussion.&nbsp; Let these hitherto mis-employed energies be
called forth&mdash;these perverted resources gathered into the
proper channels; and then may we not hope that the church of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> would present an unbroken front
to the powers of evil, and move on one compact and irresistible
host to secure the happy subjection of all things to our
Redeemer.</p>
<p><i>The cultivation of this spirit moreover</i>, <i>would place
us in a state of eminent preparedness for our glorious
work</i>.&nbsp; Our minds would no <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>longer be engaged in minor objects,
but would constantly recognize the one great end&mdash;the
conversion of the world to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; All occasions of envying,
strife, and division being removed; what agents would Christians
be in this holy enterprize?&nbsp; Men baptized with pity for
souls and love to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>&mdash;burning
with ardent zeal to make him known&mdash;counting not their lives
dear unto themselves, so that they may set forth the unsearchable
riches of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; And in answer
to the united prayers of such an united people, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would send forth his Holy Spirit as
it never yet has come.</p>
<p>Yes! beloved brethren! only let there be unity in the church,
and scenes, of which Pentecost was but a type, an imperfect
emblem, will presently appear.&nbsp; Much has been done in
preparing for the approaching harvest.&nbsp; The seed is thickly
sown, and is being sown still more thickly.&nbsp; The preached
word&mdash;millions of bibles&mdash;the hundreds of millions of
tracts&mdash;the labors of Sunday schools, and the efforts of
missionaries; all these have scattered wide the sacred
gospel.</p>
<p>And now what wait we for?&nbsp; Oh! beloved! for the shower
which these united prayers of the united church shall bring down;
then, and not till then, nations will be converted to <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>; the world will be brought to his feet
believing; earth shall raise its triumphant
song&mdash;&ldquo;Hallelujah for the <span class="smcap">Lord
God</span> omnipotent reigneth.&nbsp; The kingdoms of this world,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Hallelujah.&rdquo;&mdash;The church <i>is
one</i>.&mdash;The world is <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>.</p>
<p>Having already detained you so long, I feel reluctant to
trespass upon your patience further.&nbsp; I must however not
forget that my duty would be still more imperfectly performed
than it has been already, were I not to make honourable mention
of that great and noble society; the claims of which I would in
conclusion urge upon you.</p>
<p>I say <i>great and noble society</i>, for such verily it is;
whether you regard the broad and catholic principle upon which it
was originally founded&mdash;the eminent and pious who have
adorned its ranks&mdash;the devoted, self-denying, and exemplary
men who have been its missionaries&mdash;or the signal success
and peculiar blessing with which the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> of all grace&rdquo; has crowned its
operations.</p>
<p>These are days in which missionary societies proceed with
rapid strides; and it is interesting to a devout and enlightened
mind, to review the history of such institutions; to trace them
in the infancy of their existence, the feebleness of their first
efforts, the perils and danger attendant upon their course; and
then to rejoice in every year of their advancing strength and
prosperity.</p>
<p>In the case before us, whether we consider the signs of the
times when the foundation of this society was laid, amidst the
fall of thrones <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>and the convulsion of the civilized world; or the
limited means and feeble agency, with which it commenced its
efforts for the redemption of the nations; or the gigantic
obstacles, both at home and abroad, which were then presented to
its progress; or whether we glance at the superhuman and glorious
results, which in every sphere of its labours have rewarded its
toils; reason, no less than piety, will give utterance to
humility and praise in the poetic strains of inspiration,
&ldquo;not unto us O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, not unto
us; but to thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy
truth&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rejoice in the happy contrast presented to our view,
between the state of things <i>now</i>, and that of <i>former
days</i>.</p>
<p>When this society commenced its benevolent career, there were
many formidable obstacles with which the originators of such
institutions had to contend.&nbsp; Great ignorance and gross
mis-conception prevailed as to the real condition, social and
moral, of Pagan nations.&nbsp; The visitors of heathen countries
had contented themselves with merely glancing at the surface of
society, even often purposely refraining from a detail of evils
and enormities they could not have failed to have observed,
whilst others denied the vices they had no care to suppress, and
the existence of miseries which their own interest or influence
had served but to aggravate.</p>
<p>It was indeed maintained that the negro race in general, the
Hottentot in particular, was the connecting link between the
animal and human species, though partaking far more largely of
the attributes of the brute, than the similitude of the man.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the inhabitants of the east were
glowingly described as blest with civilization, and enlightened
by science; and although the objects and forms of their worship
were diversified, yet as their eulogists affirmed, their
veneration for their gods was sincere and unbounded; while in
social life, they were patterns of excellence&mdash;kind in their
tempers, and lovely in their manners&mdash;living to make each
other happy, and dying in the assurance of paradise
hereafter.&nbsp; Such were the popular falsehoods to be combated
and refuted, at the very outset of the missionary enterprize.</p>
<p>But where are now the advocates of Paganism, and the
apologists for Idolatry?&nbsp; The moral condition of the heathen
is better understood to-day, by the children in our schools, than
it was by the enlightened classes of society fifty years ago; and
the necessity of the gospel to meet the wants, and heal the
sufferings of mankind, has become a familiar and undisputed
truth.&nbsp; And by whom have these idle tales and gross
fabrications been exposed?&nbsp; By the men of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, sent forth from our midst, who have
lived <i>with</i> the heathen, and <i>for</i> the heathen; from
whose concurrent testimony the church has learned, <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and the world
has been constrained to admit, that idolatry in all its varied
forms, is an abominable thing; that its principles are founded on
falsehood and absurdity, and that its requirements are cruel and
obscene.</p>
<p>In the early days of missionary efforts, the fields of labour
were necessarily few and contracted.&nbsp; The wide and effectual
doors opened to us were then closed, and for admission our
revered forerunners entreated and pleaded in vain.</p>
<p>Their ardent zeal panted for access to the teeming and
degraded multitudes of India.&nbsp; But by the merchant, the
soldier, and the statesman, the christian missionary was alike
denounced and resisted.&nbsp; The robber and the spoiler were
found in the train of the British conqueror; but the minister of
heavenly mercy might not set his foot upon those distant
shores.</p>
<p>Now, thanks be to <span class="smcap">God</span>, how altered
is the scene; the legislature of our country has awarded
religious freedom to India; and now the missionary may go through
the length and breadth of that mighty empire, testifying to the
Mussulman and idolator &ldquo;repentance towards <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and faith towards our <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,&rdquo; unmolested by the
natives, and befriended by his countrymen.&nbsp; If the early
friends of missions excluded from the millions of India, turned
their attention to the colonies of the west; there the curse of
slavery rested with all its unmitigated horrors.&nbsp; And whilst
christian compassion wept over the lacerated body, or the more
tortured spirit of the deeply injured negro; the stern voice of
the oppressor forbade the application of the balm that might have
soothed and healed his bleeding heart.&nbsp; In the judgment of
the slave-holder to instruct the negro in the mild principles of
Christianity, was an offence not to be forgiven, an evil pregnant
with every conceivable danger; and of all men, the missionary was
the man most to be dreaded and detested.&nbsp; But the spirit of
justice, philanthropy, and religion, maintained the hard fought
contest, till the spirit of oppression though unchanged, was
compelled to yield; and amidst the scenes where Smith was
martyred as the friend of the slave&mdash;where the sanctuaries
of <span class="smcap">God</span> were pillaged and
destroyed&mdash;where faithful brethren were seized, imprisoned,
and threatened with death, <i>there</i> liberty has been
proclaimed to the captive, and <i>there</i> the glorious gospel
of the blessed <span class="smcap">God</span> has gladdened and
governed the hearts of thousands.&nbsp; In Southern Africa also
where the arms of our country had triumphed, British power was
exerted for the support of slavery, and the discouragement of
christian missions.&nbsp; The feelings of the colonists in
general, were well expressed by the Dutch farmer, who in reply to
the proposal of Robert Moffat to preach the gospel to his
servants, exclaimed with a <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>voice of thunder!&mdash;&ldquo;preach
to the Hottentots&mdash;preach to the dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
<i>now</i>, thanks be to the <span class="smcap">God</span> of
missions, the Hottentot is free; the Caffre is protected, and the
wandering and hostile tribes of the desert enjoy the advantages
of liberty, order, and peace; sanctified and enhanced by the
blessings of religion.</p>
<p>But surpassing all other wonders of a gracious providence on
behalf of missions&mdash;China, which from time immemorial barred
her gates against the stranger; which ten years ago appeared
equally impregnable for ages to come.&nbsp; <i>China itself is
open</i>!&nbsp; Opened to an extent far beyond our power of
occupation.&nbsp; Already the faithful evangelist proclaims the
gospel of salvation in her crowded cities, none making him
afraid, and many giving welcome to his message.</p>
<p>Of the christian missionary then, so lately proscribed in the
east and west, excluded from the deserts of Africa and the cities
of China, it may now be said &ldquo;the world is all before him
where to choose, and providence his guide.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can we
not trace the hand of <span class="smcap">God</span> in all this,
and say &ldquo;what hath <span class="smcap">God</span>
wrought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To form a just estimate of the benefits that have directly
resulted from the missionary labors of this and other kindred
societies, during the brief period of their varied efforts, it is
necessary that we should attentively consider the magnitude of
our design&mdash;the conversion of 600 millions of idolators to
christianity&mdash;a multitude diversified in habits, language,
and character&mdash;the limited amount of agency that has yet
been employed&mdash;the antiquity of the various systems of
idolatry which prevail, in contrast with the novelty and
strangeness of the gospel claims; and above all, the perfect
congeniality of heathenism, to the depraved principles and
passions of the human nature, in opposition to the humbling and
sanctifying influence of Christianity.&nbsp; These considerations
are suggested, not for the purpose of alleviating disappointment
and bespeaking forbearance to a narrative of failures; but rather
to heighten our pleasure and enlarge our gratitude, that amidst
obstacles so gigantic and with means so limited, we have in the
short space of fifty years been favored through the divine
blessing, with success so varied and abundant&mdash;success, both
in character and amount, it may be confidently affirmed, greatly
exceeding the largest expectations of the fathers of the
cause.</p>
<p>This society has laboured to bless suffering man amidst the
different forms of his guilt and misery, in Asia, Africa,
Polynesia, and the West Indies.&nbsp; And in which of these wide
fields of its mercy has it failed?&nbsp; It has laboured for his
happiness in relation to the life that now is, as well as that
which is to come, and in which of its designs of mercy has it not
succeeded?&nbsp; Behold the triumphs of christian missions in the
peaceful villages and cultivated plains of <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Africa&mdash;in the contentment and prosperity of the
West Indian freed-man&mdash;in the Polynesian savage, transformed
into the kind husband, the tender parent, and the happy man!</p>
<p>What numerous evils have not been terminated, and what daring
crimes have not been prevented by the influence of
missions?&nbsp; How many a widow, otherwise doomed to perish
amidst the horrors of the burning pile, now lives!&nbsp; How many
an infant, destined to die by the hands of its mother, is now
pressed to her bosom!&nbsp; How many a victim, marked as a
sacrifice to the gods of his country, now trusts and adores the
<span class="smcap">God</span> of salvation!&nbsp; Yes! we do
rejoice in these supplementary advantages of christian missions;
but had our success been limited to these, we should have deemed
success itself a failure.&nbsp; Our first, our noblest aim, is
not to civilize but to <i>evangelize</i> the heathen; not only to
raise the savage to the dignity of man, but to raise man to
fellowship with <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>And in every scene of conflict with error and sin, the
champions of the truth have maintained a good fight, and have
been heard exulting, &ldquo;now thanks be to <span
class="smcap">God</span> who always causeth us to triumph in
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and maketh manifest the savour
of his knowledge by us in every place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Theirs is no
empty boast, as they indulge these joyous strains.&nbsp; They
point in <i>Africa</i> to the wandering marauder, once more
ferocious than the lion which prowls amidst her sandy deserts,
now harmless and gentle as the lamb!&nbsp; In <i>India</i> to the
Brahmin, once the object of idolatry, now of scorn; once caressed
by friends and loved by kindred, now a solitary outcast;
&ldquo;but what things were gain to him, he has counted loss for
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Isles of the Pacific</i> to the man, once both the
destroyer and consumer of his fellow man; but now the cannibal
delights in peace, and breathes the amenities of love.</p>
<p>In the <i>West Indies</i> to redeemed multitudes, once in
harder and viler bondage than their crudest oppressors could
impose on their emaciated frame; but the <span class="smcap">Son
of God</span> has made them free, and &ldquo;they are free
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on the other hand this society has had to mingle her tears
with her praises, and exhibits the trials as well as the triumphs
of faith.</p>
<p>From Madagascar the shepherds have indeed been driven, and
their flocks scattered; they wander amid the wilderness as lambs
among wolves, and many have been offered as a sacrifice upon the
altar of their faith.</p>
<p>From the deserts of Siberia also, where for more than twenty
years our faithful brethren laboured with untiring zeal, to plant
amid those snowy solitudes the garden of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&mdash;they have been driven from their
much loved toil.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>In
Tahiti also, where our fathers gathered their plenteous, yet long
delayed first-fruits, we have been called to reap the bitterest
sorrow.&nbsp; The envious eye and malignant spirit of popery
could not tolerate that fair field of protestant faith and
apostolic piety; and in the Government of France she found a mind
sufficiently ungenerous, and a hand sufficiently oppressive, to
effect the desolation of that lonely island.&nbsp; Alas! freedom
bleeds, and injustice triumphs in Tahiti.&nbsp; The people have
fled from their homes to breathe the air of freedom in the
fastnesses of the mountains, and the christian queen is now a
fugitive from her native isle.</p>
<p>Nor these things only.&nbsp; Our success has provoked the zeal
of our adversaries.&nbsp; Idolatry, which once regarded our
efforts with silent scorn, now feels our power, and arms itself
for resistance.&nbsp; Popery tracks the footsteps of the
christian mission; not in Tahiti only, but in China, India,
Africa, the West Indies&mdash;on every soil they tread.</p>
<p>Yes! beloved brethren, we must not dream of repose, or allow
our past success to lull us into security or indifference.</p>
<p>The hosts of earth and hell are opposed to us; they unite in
strong phalanx against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
against His Anointed.&nbsp; <i>Unity</i> is their watch-word, for
<i>unity</i> is their strength&mdash;combination and co-operation
are their principles.&nbsp; Let us be taught by the enemy; let us
put on the whole armour of <span class="smcap">God</span>, that
we may be able to stand in the evil day; and <i>over all</i>,
&ldquo;put on charity which is the very bond of
perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember, beloved brethren, that in an united advance against
the enemy, the victory is sure.&nbsp; The Captain of our
Salvation is now gone forth conquering and to conquer.&nbsp; To
Him are given &ldquo;the heathen for his inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
&ldquo;He must reign until he shall have put all enemies under
his feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cause, the glorious cause is
advancing!&nbsp; Christians will you not help it?&nbsp; The
conflict has begun!&nbsp; Christians will you not join it?&nbsp;
The final triumph of Messiah is at hand; even now the angelic
hosts are preparing their golden harps to celebrate with the
rejoicing heaven and redeemed earth, the consummation so ardently
anticipated by the Redeemer&mdash;so long desired by the
church&mdash;so cordially hailed in promise&mdash;so fervently
supplicated in prayer; even the complete unity of the church, and
by consequence</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
